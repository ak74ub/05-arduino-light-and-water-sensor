### Description:

The goal of this project is to create a device that will measure average sunlight and soil moisture when placed in a patch of soil. The device will be built utilizing an Arduino board and sensors to measure mousture and ight levels. 

## Architecture
 **TBD**

## Details

**Needs more work here**
The arduino sensors will measure data on mousture and light levels, which will be recorded into a text file.

The Arduino source code are from a tutorial on the websites linked above. They dictate the open source code and all that is required to compile the code is the Arduino software. The websites are shown accredited to an alias of a2 to MakerPro for the moisture sensor, and Christopher Lawsâ€™s git repository for the BH1750 Library from also MakerPro. The two tutorials do discuss how they are able to take the readings from both sensors and send them to a serial file.

The breadboard is a device that will also be needed to be utilized due to their being only one 5V pin on the Arduino. The breadboard will allow us to be able to attach many sensors for that one pin.
